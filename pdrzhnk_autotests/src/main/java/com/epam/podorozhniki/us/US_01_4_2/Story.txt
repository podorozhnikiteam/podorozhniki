As a driver 
I could configure appropriate filters in my calendar
So that I could see all my trips status at the current day/week/month 
And filter confirmed/required/submitted trips and requests from travelers

Given driver submitted trips in the system
When driver browses calendar from his account
Then driver is able to filter his trips with appropriate filters
